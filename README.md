- UML modeling:
  - Use Case Diagrams
  - Class Diagrams
  - Sequence Diagrams
  - Activity and Component Diagrams

## Purpose
The project demonstrates skills in:
- business and system analysis
- requirements specification
- UML-based system design
- educational platform modeling

## Status
This repository contains documentation and design materials.  
Implementation can be extended in future iterations.
